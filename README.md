# System Programming and Computer Architecture Codes

This repository contains exercises that I've done to learn programming in C in the SPCA course

## Disclaimer

Most of the code was provided as templates, with sections marked by `TODO:` that I had to complete. My contributions are primarily focused on those portions of the code.
